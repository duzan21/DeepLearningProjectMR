# Deep Learning Project Modulation Recognition
project for deep learning course 2020 TAU, the project is about Modulation Recognition. <br/>
In this document we will describe how to run the code, train the different models and present our results. <br/>

Have Fun!

prerequisite: you have access to a drive with the dataset pkl.

## <a name="desc"/> Notebook Description
We have one notebook called "Training and Analysis.ipynb" for easy use.

The notebook is divided into parts:
  1.	Hyperparams â€“ there you can set different parameters for running.
      1. action:
        1. "Training" - train the network
        2. "Analysis" - load trained network
      2. networkType:
        1. CNN2 - the architecture used in "Convolutional Radio Modulation Recognition
Networks 2016"
        2. CNN2_switch_kernels - the CNN2 architecture with switched kernel.
        3. CNN2_FFT - the CNN2 architecture with FFT and time samples as input.
        4. CNN2_ENSEMBLE - ensemble of the  fft and time samples using CNN2 architecture
        5. VGG - the CNN architecture inspire by VGG.
        6. VGG_ENSEMBLE - ensemble of the  fft and time samples using VGG architecture
      3. dataSet:
        1. 2016.04C.multisnr - the old data set used in "Convolutional Radio Modulation Recognition
Networks 2016"
        2. RML2016.10a_dict - the new data set that supersedes 2016.04C.multisnr
  2.  Imports and mount google drive - importing python modules we use and mount google drive. 
  3.  Dataset setup and FFT preprocess - read the dataset from the drive and preprocess the data.
  4.  Setting up the network - there we setting up the network according to networkType and prints it contents.
  5.  Model Training - there you can run logic to train models and save them for later analysis.
      1. Training helper functions - setup some helper functions in training.
      2. Network training loop - setup the actual training loop.
      3. Train network! - train the network, the action parameter should be set to "Training".
  6.  Evaluate and Plot Model Performance - there you can run logic to evaluate one model that was chosen using networkType.
      1. Confusion matrix helper functions - setup some helper functions for confusion matrix.
      2. Model analysis helper functions - setup some helper functions for accuracy analysis.
      3. Perform Single model analysis - analyze current dataset and networkType, show confusion matrix for each SNR, and plot accuracy graph.
  7.  Analyze all models' history, and compare models + data - there you can run several scripts that summeries our results
      1. Analyze all saved models at all epochs - we analyze each network type and dataset and plot accuracy graph.
      2. Compare models and data - show data summary for all of the networkType:
          * print sensativity for each dataset
          * plot accuracy graph for each networkType containing the two dataset results
          * plot accuracy graph of all the network type for each dataset
      3. Plot data time + frequency samples, and modulations probabilities - plot the dataset time and frequency samples in high snr, and show the modulation probabilities for             each data set 


## <a name="train"/> Train The Network
First in the Hyperparams you should config:
1.	action: "Training"
2.	networkType: your desired network type.
3.  dataSet: youe desired dataset.
After that run: 
1. Hyperparams -> Imports and mount google drive -> Dataset setup and FFT preprocess -> Setting up the network -> Model Training
This will result in having a trained model so now you can run:
Evaluate and Plot Model Performance -> will show confusion matrix and plot accuracy graph.

## <a name="analyze_train"/> Analyze Trained Network
First in the Hyperparams you should config:
1.	action: "Analysis"
2.	networkType: your desired network type.
3.  dataSet: youe desired dataset.
After that run: 
1. Hyperparams -> Imports and mount google drive -> Dataset setup and FFT preprocess -> Setting up the network
This will result in having a a configurable environment, so you can run:
Evaluate and Plot Model Performance -> will show confusion matrix and plot accuracy graph.

## <a name="results"/> Show Summary of The Results
First in the Hyperparams you should config:
1.	action: "Analysis"
2.	networkType: your desired network type.
3.  dataSet: youe desired dataset.
After that run: 
1. Hyperparams -> Imports and mount google drive -> Dataset setup and FFT preprocess -> Setting up the network
This will result in having a a configurable environment, so you can run:
Analyze all models' history, and compare models + data -> will show a summary of our results.

## <a name="dataset"/> Obtaining the dataset
the datasets can be downloaded from: https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets <br/>
our simulation is suitable to: 2016.04C, 2016.10A datasets. <br/>
you should put the "pkl" files in your drive and update rootDir variable in hyper parameters.
